### Introduction
This repository is for our IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG) 2020 paper 'DNF-Net: a Deep Normal Filtering Network for Mesh Denoising'. In this paper, we present a deep normal filtering network, called DNF-Net, for mesh denoising. To better capture local geometry, our network processes the mesh in terms of local patches extracted from the mesh. Overall, DNF-Net is an end-to-end network that takes patches of facet normals as inputs and directly outputs the corresponding denoised facet normals of patches. In this way, we can reconstruct the geometry from the denoised normals with feature preservation. Besides the overall network architecture, our contributions include a novel multi-scale feature embedding unit, a residual learning strategy to remove noise, and a deeply-supervised joint loss function.
